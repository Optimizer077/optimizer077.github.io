Our proposed method, the Shadow Neural Radiance Field (S-NeRF) follows recent advances in implicit volumetric representation learning. For each scene, we train S-NeRF using very high spatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learning requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky), we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility ﬁeld. Second, indirect illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color ﬁeld as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared to NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full 3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and transient object ﬁltering, without any explicit shape supervision.","2021-04-20","2025-04-11 02:41:03","2025-04-11 02:41:03","2025-04-11 02:41:03","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2104.09877 [cs]","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/VD7CHXSY/Derksen and Izzo - 2021 - Shadow Neural Radiance Fields for Multi-view Satellite Photogrammetry.pdf","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2104.09877","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focuses on detecting landslides from high-resolution optical satellite images using CNN-based methods, providing opportunities for recognizing latent landslides and updating large-scale landslide inventory with high accuracy and time efficiency. Considering the variety of landslides and complicated backgrounds, attention mechanisms originated from the human visual system are developed for boosting the CNN to extract more distinctive feature representations of landslides from backgrounds. As deep learning needs a large number of labeled data to train a learning model, we manually prepared a landslide dataset which is located in the Bijie city, China. In the dataset, 770 landslides, including rock falls, rock slides, and a few debris slides, were interpreted by geologists from the satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) data and further checked by fieldwork. The landslide data was separated into a training set that trains the attention boosted CNN model and a testing set that evaluates the performance of the model with a ratio of 2:1. The experimental results showed that the best F1score of landslide detection reached 96.62%. The results also proved that the performance of our spatial-channel attention mechanism was fairly over other recent attention mechanisms. Additionally, the effectiveness of predicting new potential landslides with high efficiency based on our dataset is demonstrated.","2020-06","2025-04-11 02:41:23","2025-04-11 02:41:23","2025-04-11 02:41:23","1337-1352","","6","17","","Landslides","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/QS92GC97/Ji et al. - 2020 - Landslide detection from an open satellite imagery and digital elevation model dataset using attenti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remote sensing is no exception, as the possibility to estimate height maps from single aerial or satellite imagery bears great potential in the context of topographic reconstruction. A few pioneering investigations have demonstrated the general feasibility of single image height prediction from optical remote sensing images and motivate further studies in that direction. With this paper, we present the ﬁrst-ever demonstration of deep learning-based single image height prediction for the other important sensor modality in remote sensing: synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Besides the adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for SAR intensity images, we present a workﬂow for the generation of training data, and extensive experimental results for different SAR imaging modes and test sites. Since we put a particular emphasis on transferability, we are able to conﬁrm that deep learning-based single-image height estimation is not only possible, but also transfers quite well to unseen data, even if acquired by different imaging modes and imaging parameters.","2021-11-19","2025-04-11 02:41:26","2025-04-11 02:41:26","2025-04-11 02:41:26","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2111.02061 [cs]","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/V9UATKDU/Recla and Schmitt - 2021 - Deep-Learning-Based Single-Image Height Reconstruction from Very-High-Resolution SAR Intensity Data.pdf","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2111.02061","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the models proposed to date assume the availability of pre-processed RGB images as input. This contrasts with the multispectral nature of raw satellite products. Optical satellite sensors do not acquire RGB images but a wider variety of spectral bands, which may have different spatial resolution. We propose a NeRF framework to simultaneously handle panchromatic data and lower resolution spectral bands (e.g., color bands), and investigate the contribution of the low-resolution bands to the output model. Our method achieves comparable or better results with respect to previous approaches that rely on a separate pansharpening step. The model can also be used to generate a pansharpened image surrogate for each input view, as it natively performs super-resolution in the color bands.","","2025-04-11 02:41:40","2025-04-11 02:41:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/8C9WGYYC/Pic et al. - Pseudo Pansharpening NeRF for Satellite Image Collections.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To capture the cross-modal prior from both of the LR-RGB and HR-PAN images, for the Unet-shaped architecture, we adapt the encoder with explicit spectral-to-spatial convolution (SSConv) to enhance the multimodal representation ability. To support the generalization ability of psRPF across scenes, we adopt projection loss to ensure strong geometry self-supervision.

This article proposes rpcPRF, a multiplane image (MPI)-based planar neural radiance field for rational polynomial camera (RPC), exhibits robust performance even with single or sparse inputs. Unlike coordinate-based NeRFs that require sufficient views of one scene, our model can be applied to new scenes and has shown positive results for single or sparse test images. This allows for generalization across various scenes. To achieve generalization across scenes, we use reprojection supervision to ensure that the predicted MPI accurately captures the geometry between the 3-D coordinates and the images. In addition, we have obviated the requisite for dense depth supervision in multiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance fields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the advantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while learning the 3-D structure. On the DFC2019 dataset with sparse input of the same scene, rpcPRF achieves the best results. On the TLC dataset and the SatMVS3D dataset with changing scenes in every batch, rpcPRF outperforms stateof-the-art NeRF-based methods by a significant margin in terms of image fidelity, reconstruction accuracy, and efficiency, for both single-view and multiview tasks.","2024","2025-04-11 02:41:49","2025-04-11 02:41:49","","","","","62","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/BUKSI6Z8/Zhang et al. - 2024 - rpcPRF Generalizable MPI Neural Radiance Field for Satellite Camera With Single and Sparse Views.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
