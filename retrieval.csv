Departing from the prevalent focus on performance enhancements, this work prioritizes the crucial trade-off between performance and memory requirements. The proposed model uses a transformer-based architecture designed to estimate image-to-image similarity by capturing interactions within and across images based on their local descriptors. A distinctive property of the model is the capability for asymmetric similarity estimation. Database images are represented with a smaller number of descriptors compared to query images, enabling performance improvements without increasing memory consumption. To ensure adaptability across different applications, a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase. Results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both hand-crafted and learned models. In particular, compared with current state-of-the-art methods that overlook their memory footprint, our approach not only attains superior performance but does so with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

However, the scalability of this method is often limited due to the significant storage and computation cost incurred by local feature matching in the reranking stage. In this paper, we present SuperGlobal, a novel approach that exclusively employs global features for both stages, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. SuperGlobal introduces key enhancements to the retrieval system, specifically focusing on the global feature extraction and reranking processes. For extraction, we identify sub-optimal performance when the widely-used ArcFace loss and Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling methods are combined and propose several new modules to improve GeM pooling. In the reranking stage, we introduce a novel method to update the global features of the query and top-ranked images by only considering feature refinement with a small set of images, thus being very compute and memory efficient. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the state of the art in standard benchmarks. Notably, on the Revisited Oxford+1M Hard dataset, our single-stage results improve by 7.1%, while our two-stage gain reaches 3.7% with a strong 64, 865× speedup. Our two-stage system surpasses the current single-stage state-of-the-art by 16.3%, offering a scalable, accurate alternative for high-performing image retrieval systems with minimal time overhead.

This model is used for image retrieval, where typically a first ranking is performed with an efficient similarity measure, and then a shortlist of top-ranked images is re-ranked based on a more fine-grained similarity measure. Compared to existing methods that perform pair-wise similarity estimation with local descriptors or list-wise re-ranking with global descriptors, LOCORE is the first method to perform list-wise re-ranking with local descriptors. To achieve this, we leverage efficient long-context sequence models to effectively capture the dependencies between query and gallery images at the local-descriptor level. During testing, we process long shortlists with a sliding window strategy that is tailored to overcome the context size limitations of sequence models. Our approach achieves superior performance compared with other re-rankers on established image retrieval benchmarks of landmarks (ROxf and RPar), products (SOP), fashion items (In-Shop), and bird species (CUB-200) while having comparable latency to the pair-wise local descriptor re-rankers.","2025-03-27","2025-05-28 02:16:59","2025-05-28 02:16:59","2025-05-28 02:16:59","","","","","","","LOCORE","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2503.21772 [cs] version: 1","","/Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/RIX24WCS/Xiao et al. - 2025 - LOCORE Image Re-ranking with Long-Context Sequence Modeling.pdf; /Users/alihaider/Zotero/storage/9K2GSYJT/2503.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2503.21772","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
